# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaron Lin

Iâ€™m a high school junior passionate about mathematics, physics, and computer science. I love solving problems, proving theorems, building tools, and teaching others.

Currently, Iâ€™m:
- Wrapping up a research project on **region-counting in hyperplane arrangements** with MIT PRIMES-USA.
- Preparing for a summer of research at the **MIT Research Science Institute (RSI)**.
- Teaching math through **Po-Shen Lohâ€™s LIVE** program.
- Exploring ways to **enhance math education with AI**, which I proposed to the Non-Trivial Fellowship program.
