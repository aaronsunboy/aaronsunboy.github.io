	<h1>About me</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>In January 2015, I played my first chess tournament organized by the <a href="http://www.gatewaychess.org/"> Gateway Chess League. </a> I won 1, drew 1 and lost 2 games. I lost one game because I was too short to reach the pieces at my opponent's end and accicidentally messed up the board. </li>
		<li>In March 2017, I become the scholastic champion of Missouri in the 3rd grade and under division. <a href="http://www.gatewaychess.org/1617/mosc_res.html"> Result
